# SQL_Portfolio_Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of SQL queries developed for exploring, analysing, and managing datasets across a range of domains. These projects showcase the use of SQL for everything from data cleaning and transformation to advanced querying and insight generation.

## Key Features:
- Data Extraction & Querying – Use of SELECT statements, joins, and conditions to retrieve relevant and structured information from relational databases.
- Aggregation & Reporting – Apply grouping, filtering, and window functions to generate meaningful summaries and metrics.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries to prepare data for analysis.
- Optimisation & Best Practices – Focus on writing efficient queries and using indexing strategies when needed to enhance performance.

This repository is designed to be a flexible resource for SQL-based data work, adaptable to various niches—whether it's business analytics, research datasets, public data exploration, or general-purpose querying. More projects will be added over time as I continue to explore different datasets and use cases.
